\section{Introduction, motivation and aims}

\subsection{Motivation}

Concurrency is a concept which is very hard to simulate in our brains.
Rephrasing my supervisor: if sequential programs have a linear state space of
$O(n)$, then concurrent programs have an exponential state space of $O(2^n)$,
which is perhaps the core issue.

Historically, either (unsafe) ad-hoc approaches have (and mostly still are)
been used or formal models were created for proving the correctness of
concurrent algorithms and then translated into an actual implementation.

Naturally, both approaches are quite unsustainable and it is a shame that,
despite having progressed research in the area quite a bit, most software
systems are still handling concurrent resources "manually" (i.e. with e.g.
minimal-to-none help from the compiler) in practice.

Hence the initial aim of this project was to explore advances in programming
language research which would help us solve these problems. This idea
crystallised into an attempt to explore the power of Dependent Types, in
particular, the way they are used in Idris and attempting to use ideas from
previous work on concurrent resource handling~\cite{cbconc-fi} and combine them
with a new approach~\cite{eff} to handling programs with side effects as
implemented in the Effects~\cite{effects-idr} library of Idris.

\subsection{Dependent Types and type safety}

Normally in programming languages types and values are kept completely
distinct. The main benefit of this approach is that type inference is much
simpler and, in fact, decidable.

However, this means that it is very hard or impossible to precisely
describe some of the data structures and flows of your program. In a type
system with dependent types, the distinction between values and types is
blurred and hence in dependently typed programming languages types are
first-class citizens~\cite[p.~3]{idris-tutorial} and can be manipulated as any
other term.

The bad side is that type checking becomes, in general, undecidable.

The good part of this is that you can describe your data with "arbitrary"
precision. A typical example of a data structure possible with dependent types
is a fixed-length list, i.e. a vector. Which could be expressed as:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{vect}

-- expressed as Haskell-style data-type: parametrised over a length and a type
data Vect : Nat -> Type -> Type where
  -- empty vector constructor, Z stands for 0
  Nil  : Vect Z a
  -- the standard cons operator, where `S` is the natural number successor operator
  (::) : a -> Vect n a -> Vect (S n) a

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{vect}

which makes it possible to, e.g. describe the standard "list-type" functions
such as \texttt{head} and appending very precisely:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{headtail}

-- ensure the vector is non-empty by matching the length as (S n)
head : Vect (S n) a -> a
head (x::xs) = x

-- precisely describe the output vector length
(++) : Vect m a -> Vect n a -> Vect (m + n) a
(++) []      ys = ys
(++) (x::xs) ys = x :: xs ++ ys

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{headtail}

@TODO: improve/remove, this is super vague:

In general, having Dependent Types allows parametrising types over any terms,
which means one is able to create complicated data structures using the
expressive type system.

\subsection{Idris}

Idris is a research language with Dependent Types influenced by Haskell, which
tries to be a general purpose language aimed at systems programming (via easy
interfacing with C, compilation to multiple backends (C, JavaScript, Java)).

Since my goal was to solve a practical problem of making it easier to work with
resources in a concurrent setting, Idris, due to its aims, seemed as a perfect
experimentation platform.
