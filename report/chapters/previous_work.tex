\section{The previous work}

My work mainly builds upon Edwin Brady's and Kevin Hammond's work on managing
concurrent resources in Idris and a general framework for handling effectful
programs.

\subsection{The concurrent resource management eDSL}

In the "Correct-by-Construction Concurrency"~\cite{cbconc-fi} paper, an
embedded domain specific language for managing concurrent resources using
ordered locks is implemented, which ensures thread-safe and deadlock-free usage
of resources, which is formally proved in the paper.

\subsection{Algebraic Effects}

@TODO: talk about Algebraic Effects in general and explain the main concepts of
the Effects library in Idris.
