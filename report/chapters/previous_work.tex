\section{Previous work}

Our work mainly builds upon Edwin Brady's and Kevin Hammond's work on managing
concurrent resources in Idris~\cite{cbconc-fi} and Brady's Effects
library~\cite{effects-idr} for programming using algebraic effects in Idris.

\subsection{A concurrent resource management eDSL}

In the ``Correct-by-Construction Concurrency'' (CbC)~\cite{cbconc-fi} paper, an
embedded domain specific language for managing concurrent resources using
ordered locks is implemented. The eDSL ensures thread-safe and deadlock-free
usage of resources, which is formally proved in the paper.

The implementation of our effect closely follows the way shared resource usage
was modelled in the CbC paper.

\subsection{Algebraic Effects}

Algebraic effects are a relatively new approach to handling computation with
side-effects. From a pragmatic point of view, one could see algebraic effects
as a more modular and convenient approach to managing effectful code than
monads. Firstly this is because a single algebraic effect can have many
\emph{handlers} which determine the actual execution of the effect, hence
making effects highly re-usable and modular. Secondly, algebraic effects
compose naturally, unlike monads where one has to often take explicit care of
the ordering and use monad transformers for composition.

For more information on algebraic effects we refer the reader to Andrej Bauer's
and Matija Pretnar's implementation of \texttt{Eff}~\cite{eff} and also Edwin
Brady's work~\cite{effects-idr}.

In this paper we use the algebraic effects as they are implemented in the
Effects library of Idris.
