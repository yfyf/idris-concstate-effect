\section{Further Reading}

Further information about \Idris{} programming, and programming with dependent
types in general, can be obtained from various sources:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \Idris{} web site (\url{http://idris-lang.org/}) and by asking questions
on the mailing list.
\item The IRC channel \texttt{\#idris}, on \url{chat.freenode.net}.
\item Examining the prelude and exploring the \texttt{samples} in the distribution.
\item Various papers (e.g. \cite{plpv11, scrap-engine,res-dsl-padl12}). These mostly describe
older versions of \Idris{}.
\end{itemize}
